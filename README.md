# <Eric-Peterson-Portfolio>

## Description

I wanted to create a more sophisticated portfolio that showcases my fullstack project thus far. Throughout my time in the 2U/Austin coding bootcamp, I've created over 15 projects utilizing various frameworks and technologies, and I wanted to showcase size projects that best exhibit these skills. Currently I have six project displayed, but it's easy to add or adjust this list as I continue to create/develop/tweak fullstack projects. I also wanted to include a form for viewers to reach out. Finally, I wanted to include a link for downloading my resume, as well as high-level bullet points of my experience and skills. I created all of this using React + Vite, a useful frontend technology we learned recently. This allows for reusable components and overall more simple and efficient code.

My portfolio is hopefully simple to use and straightforward. It's divided into four sections:

1. About Me: this is a small description of who I am, where I'm coming from, and what my future career goals are.
2. Portfolio: this exhibits six of my projects. Each project has a link to the deployed application as well as the GitHub repository.
3. Contact: this form allows the user to send me a message. Note that this message will not be sent without a valid Email address. Empty messages will also throw an error.
4. Resume: this shows some of my skills thus far. You can click the link 'Download my portfolio here' to get a PDF version of my resume.

These can be accessed on the righthand panel. Additionally, I've linked my Github and LinkedIn profiles here.
