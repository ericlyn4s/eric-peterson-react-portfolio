        <h1>About Me</h1>
          <h2>I'm a recent graduate of the 2U/UT Austin Texas coding bootcamp, where I gained a strong foundation in full-stack web development. With a 
          background as an operations analysis, I approach my work analytically and with a consideration for efficiency. My current focus is on frontend development, and I'm eager to break into the field and build dynamic user experiences.
          Please peruse my portfolio and I look forward to hearing from you!</h2>
